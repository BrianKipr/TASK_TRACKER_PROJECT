# Task Tracker
** Hi there iam, **Briankipr**

Users can successfully manage their chores with the aid of the online application Task Tracker. Users can create, amend, delete, and keep tabs on the status of their tasks using this tool. To deliver a user-friendly interface and seamless task management experience, the application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Task Creation: Users can create new tasks quickly and easily by specifying the task title, due date, and priority level.
* Editing Tasks: Users can edit already-existing tasks to change the title, due date, and priority.
Users can delete tasks that are no longer required.
* Task Progress Tracking: By marking tasks as finished, users may see how far along a task is in completion.
* Task Categorization: To facilitate better organization and management, users can divide work into several projects or categories.
* Filtering and Sorting: Users can sort and filter tasks based on a variety of factors, including priority, category, and due date.
Data persistence enables users to access and manage their tasks even after refreshing the page or quitting the program because task data is maintained locally.
